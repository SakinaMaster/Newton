Welcome to the game of Newton, where you try to be the first to get 5 in a row either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
Two players alternate making moves. On each turn you may enter the column number in which your marble is to be placed. The marble is inserted from the top and slides down as far as it can go in that column. You may also enter 'r' to rotate a piece out of the bottom of a column to be dropped back in at the top of that same column.
Enter 'x'to exit the game.
